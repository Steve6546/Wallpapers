Welcome to AZM AI, an advanced platform for software development agents powered by AI.

AZM AI agents can do anything a human developer can: modify code, run commands, browse the web,
call APIs, and yes‚Äîeven copy code snippets from StackOverflow.

## üöÄ Key Features

- **Powerful AI Agents**: Leverage state-of-the-art LLMs to automate software development tasks
- **Web Browsing**: Agents can search the web, read documentation, and find solutions online
- **Code Editing**: Seamlessly modify code across multiple files and languages
- **Command Execution**: Run terminal commands and interpret their outputs
- **Flexible Deployment**: Run locally, in the cloud, or integrate with your existing tools
- **Extensible Architecture**: Add custom tools and capabilities to meet your specific needs

Learn more in our [GitHub Wiki](https://github.com/Steve6546/azm-ai/wiki) to get started.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Using AZM AI for work? We'd love to chat! Contact us at

## ‚òÅÔ∏è AZM AI Cloud
The easiest way to get started with AZM AI is on our cloud platform,
contact us to learn more about our cloud offerings.

## üíª Running AZM AI Locally

AZM AI can run on your local system using Docker. Here's how to get started:

### System Requirements
- **Docker**: Latest stable version
- **Memory**: At least 8GB RAM (16GB+ recommended)
- **Disk Space**: 10GB+ free space
- **CPU**: 4+ cores recommended
- **Internet Connection**: Required for LLM API calls and web browsing

See our [Wiki](https://github.com/Steve6546/azm-ai/wiki) for
detailed system requirements and more information.

> [!WARNING]
> On a public network? See our [Security Guide](https://github.com/Steve6546/azm-ai/wiki/Security)
> to secure your deployment by restricting network binding and implementing additional security measures.


```bash
docker pull ghcr.io/steve6546/azm-ai/runtime:latest

docker run -it --rm --pull=always \
    -e SANDBOX_RUNTIME_CONTAINER_IMAGE=ghcr.io/steve6546/azm-ai/runtime:latest \
    -e LOG_ALL_EVENTS=true \
    -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock \
    -v ~/.azm-ai-state:/.azm-ai-state \
    -p 3000:3000 \
    -p 12001:12001 \
    --add-host host.docker.internal:host-gateway \
    --name azm-ai-app \
    ghcr.io/steve6546/azm-ai/azm-ai:latest
```

You'll find AZM AI running at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)!

When you open the application, you'll be asked to choose an LLM provider and add an API key.
[Anthropic's Claude 3.5 Sonnet](https://www.anthropic.com/api) (`anthropic/claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022`)
works best, but you have many options available.

## üí° Other ways to run AZM AI

> [!CAUTION]
> AZM AI is meant to be run by a single user on their local workstation.
> It is not appropriate for multi-tenant deployments where multiple users share the same instance. There is no built-in authentication, isolation, or scalability.
>
> If you're interested in running AZM AI in a multi-tenant environment, please
> [contact us](https://github.com/Steve6546)
> for advanced deployment options.

You can also connect AZM AI to your local filesystem,
run AZM AI in a scriptable headless mode,
interact with it via a friendly CLI,
or run it on tagged issues with a github action.

Visit our Wiki for more information and setup instructions.
